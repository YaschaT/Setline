# Setline — native iOS (Phase 1)

SwiftUI app built against the approved Claude Design handoff. Phase 1 is the
foundations plus one vertical slice: sign in, today's session, log a set, see
the comparison, finish.

## Open it

```bash
open ios/Setline.xcodeproj
```

Scheme **Setline**, any iPhone simulator, or your own device (set a team under
Signing & Capabilities first — the project ships with automatic signing and no
team, so a device build needs one).

## Accounts

`Setline.xcconfig` is git-ignored and holds the same two values the web app
reads from `.env.local`:

```
SUPABASE_URL = your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your-anon-key
```

Copy `Setline.xcconfig.example` if it is missing. Without both, the sign-in
screen says accounts are not connected and names the keys, rather than showing
a form that cannot work.

The app signs in against the same Supabase project as the web app and reads
and writes the same `public.user_state` row, so both stay in step.

## Sync with the web app

Both apps share one `public.user_state` row and follow one loop: read the
latest row, apply only this client's own changes, write only if the row is
still at the version that was read, and otherwise read again and reapply. iOS
sends its changes (`StateChange`), never its copy of the state. The web app
merges its page state against the state it provably started from
(`lib/state-merge.ts`). Both clients are held to the scenarios in
`tests/fixtures/sync`.

### Known technical debt

- **Device clocks decide deletions and resets.** A deletion record
  (`syncTombstones`) or an account reset (`syncReset`) is compared with the time
  a change was made, as each device's own clock recorded it. A badly wrong clock
  can let a change made just before a deletion win, or drop one made just after.
  Accepted for V1.
- **Deletion records expire after 180 days.** A device that stays offline for
  longer, holding a change to a session deleted meanwhile, can bring that
  session back.
- **Deletions from before deletion records existed left no trace.** A device
  copy saved by a build older than the change log is recovered by adding what
  the account lacks, so a session deleted on the web before then would come back
  from it.

## Run without an account

Two DEBUG-only launch arguments, for development and screenshots. They use
fabricated data; `PRIVATE-DATA/` is never bundled.

| Argument | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `-SetlineDemoData` | Signs in as a demo user with three prior push sessions |
| `-SetlineOpenSession` | Opens straight into today's session |
| `-SetlineLoggedSets` | Writes the first two sets, so delta and PR states show |
| `-SetlineComplete` | Jumps to the session summary |

Set them under Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme → Run → Arguments.

## Tests

The domain, engine, catalogue and legacy adapter live in `SetlineCore`, a
plain Swift package with no UI, so the whole training engine is testable on
macOS without a simulator:

```bash
cd ios/SetlineCore && swift test
```

The acceptance gate is `LegacyRoundTripTests`: it reads the real export at
`PRIVATE-DATA/yascha-training-backup.json` in place, imports it, writes it
back and asserts nothing changed. It skips itself when that file is absent.

## Regenerating the catalogue

`ExerciseCatalog`, `GuidanceCatalog`, `AlternativesCatalog` and `PlanCatalog`
are generated from `app/page.tsx` so the Dutch content is carried over rather
than retyped:

```bash
python3 ios/SetlineCore/Tools/generate.py
```

Run it from the repository root. `Tools/attrs.py` holds the hand-authored
per-exercise attributes (equipment, role, compound, unilateral); everything
else comes from the web app.
